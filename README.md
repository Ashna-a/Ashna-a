Hi, I’m Ashna 👋

I’m a Senior Frontend Engineer based in Berlin, Germany, with 8+ years of experience building high-scale, customer-facing B2C web applications. I specialize in React, TypeScript, and modern frontend architectures, with a strong focus on performance, maintainability, and clean user experiences.

I enjoy working on complex frontend systems — from micro-frontends and design systems to performance-critical Next.js applications — and owning features end-to-end in distributed, agile teams.

Currently, I’m exploring:
- Performance optimization & Core Web Vitals at scale
- Micro-frontend architectures with Next.js (SSR / ISR / Edge)
- AI-assisted development workflows to accelerate engineering velocity

In the past, I’ve led frontend efforts for platforms with 1M+ users, mentored engineers through code reviews, and collaborated closely with design, product, and backend teams to ship reliable, user-centric features.
